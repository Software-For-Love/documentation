# Onboarding: Marketing

Hey Marketers! Glad you could make it (:

I have for you a few small challenges that shouldn't be too difficult to complete!

> Make sure to communicate on the #onboarding channel on Discord to get feedback!

## Some goals

Our goal is to:

-   Come up with our organization bio!
-   Create an intro post for social media!

## Some information you'll need

> This will help provide you with context for when you're structuring some of your work

-   Our name is Software For Love
-   We are a charitable software solution organization based in Ottawa
-   Our goal is to use our talents to give back to the community
-   Our initial plan is to develop software for clients in return for
    -   A charitable contribution from them ($ to be defined on our website)
    -   A charitable service by their organization
-   We could also be delivering a service directly to a charity
-   Our team will offer a variety of services:
    -   Website
        -   Development
        -   Redesign
        -   Maintenance (if we get a contract)
    -   Development of custom software solutions (mini-projects only (i.e 2-3 months development max))
    -   Contribution to open source projects
    -   Feature development
    -   Etc...
-   Ideally clients would be able to reach out to us:
    -   on our website by selecting one of our various plans (which you guys will help make look appealing)
    -   or through email/socials

## What you need to do

You're going to need to come up with a bio for the Software For Love pages (i.e. Instagram/FB/LinkedIn/Blog)!

You can make separate ones for each - ideally they wouldn't be too different but it's up to you! Work your magic.

> Doesn't need to be perfect! Something needs to be there though.

We're going to do some peer reviewing of our bios on the Slack!

Your next task is to make a great introduction post. (We'll focus primarily on a blog style post and figure out how to port the message to different medias at a later time (i.e. with templates and some cool code!))

Take some time to read the information above and follow this template:

-   [https://convertkit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/blog-post-draft-template.pdf](https://convertkit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/blog-post-draft-template.pdf)

Above will give you a general idea of how to create a post, but we're probably going to end up developing our own in-house template - so don't be afraid to mess around!

> Make sure to ask for feedback!

So you're going to:

1. Come up with a cool bio!
2. Create a nice introduction post (introducing ourselves and our mission etc...)!
3. Give feedback to others for both tasks!

Upload your work iteratively so you can get a lot of feedback!

This should be completed within _7 days_ of you being assigned this task!

Good luck!
