# Onboarding: Project Manager

Hey PM people! Glad you could make it (:

I have for you a few small challenges that shouldn't be too difficult to complete!

> Make sure to communicate on the #onboarding channel on Discord to get feedback!

## Some goals

Our goal is to:

-   Create our first website feature proposal!
-   Get used to triage with GitHub.

## What you need to do

You're going to come up with an idea for a feature that can be implemented on our website!

> Example: A "Contact us" footer correct with email, and description input forms, and a submit button!

That being said, don't worry if you cant come up with something mindblowing!

It needs to be:

-   Simple (not to say too easy)
-   Feasible (you're not making us build a spaceship)
-   Time bound (max development time should be about 1-2months).

> Doesn't need to be perfect! Something needs to be there though.

Please take a look at the way Golang does proposals and **follow their template**:

-   [https://github.com/golang/proposal/blob/master/design/TEMPLATE.md](https://github.com/golang/proposal/blob/master/design/TEMPLATE.md)

> Note that some of the categories/text blobs in the template will not be applicable for new features, don't worry! Use what you feel is appropriate. Also make sure not to write an essay (: - keep it short and concise.

We're going to review each others ideas together on the Slack!

Send your project to the channel and people will give constructive feedback.

You're also going to have to understand the basics of GitHub issues and projects:

-   [https://github.com/features/project-management/](https://github.com/features/project-management/)

Please take a look at how we use Issues to keep track of components we need at uoDrone:

-   [https://github.com/uOttawaDrone/wish-list/blob/master/docs/HOWTO.md](https://github.com/uOttawaDrone/wish-list/blob/master/docs/HOWTO.md)

So you're going to:

1. Create a feature proposal
2. Give feedback to others
3. Create a new Issue under: [Issues](https://github.com/Software-For-Love/obstacle-course/issues) with your feature proposal!

Take a look at my issue: [https://github.com/Software-For-Love/obstacle-course/issues/1](https://github.com/Software-For-Love/obstacle-course/issues/1)

This should be completed within _7 days_ of you being assigned this task!

Good luck!
