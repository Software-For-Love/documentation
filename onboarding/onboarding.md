# Welcome to the Team!

We're excited to have you join the team.

Before you join your respective team, we ask all our members to complete a quick but essential onboarding process.

Make sure you have access to:

-   Software For Love Shared Google Drive
-   Calendar events for Software For Love
    -   All Hands (every 4 weeks)
    -   Tech Team Meetings (for SWE/PM/Designers)
    -   Game Nights (every 4 weeks)
-   Slack
    -   Channels for your specific roles and teams

Once this is done, you should receive a message and introduction by your Project Manager. If you are missing any of the above, please notify the #onboarding channel.
