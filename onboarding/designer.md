# Onboarding: Designers

Hey Designers! Glad you could make it (:

We have for you a few small challenges that shouldn't be too difficult to complete!

> Make sure to communicate on the #onboarding channel on Discord to get feedback!

First and foremost:

1. Create a Github [account](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account)
2. Send your Github username to Hrithik on Discord to be added to the SFL Github org
3. [Learn](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/git-and-github-learning-resources) about Github
4. Set up [Git](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/set-up-git)

## Some goals

Our goal is to:

-   Design a landing page for any of our current projects or a new idea that you might have!
-   Get used to Figma
-   Work together!

## What you need to do

You're going to design your own version of a landing page for a current or new project on Figma!

> Doesn't need to be perfect! Something needs to be there though.

Send your Figma project to the `#onboarding` channel and people will give constructive feedback.

So you're going to:

1. Design a landing page for any of our current projects or a new idea that you might have!
2. Give feedback to others

This should be completed within _7 days_ of you being assigned this task!

Good luck!
