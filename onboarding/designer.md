# Onboarding: Designers

Hey Designers! Glad you could make it (:

I have for you a few small challenges that shouldn't be too difficult to complete!

> Make sure to communicate on the #onboarding channel on Discord to get feedback!

First and foremost:

1. Create a Github [account](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account)
2. Send your Github username to Hrithik on Discord to be added to the SFL Github org
3. [Learn](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/git-and-github-learning-resources) about Github
4. Set up [Git](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/set-up-git)

## Some goals

Our goal is to:

-   Design the "Coming Soon" page for our website!
-   Get used to Figma
-   Work together!

## What you need to do

You're going to design your own version of the "Coming Soon" page for our website on Figma!

> Doesn't need to be perfect! Something needs to be there though.

We're going to review each others designs together on the Slack!
Send your Figma project to the channel and people will give constructive feedback.

So you're going to:

1. Design the "Coming Soon" page
2. Give feedback to others

This should be completed within _7 days_ of you being assigned this task!

Good luck!
