### Data Science
     - Resources to get started 
       - https://hrithiks-notes.netlify.app/ai - These are the notes I took for CSI4106 - Intro to AI at uOttawa.
       - https://ml-course.github.io/ - This is a course curated with Notes, Sample Code & Projects. The concepts here are pretty abstract, but definitely still helpful in terms of learning the theory. I strongly suggest you go through the Labs as they are more hands on.
       - https://pandas.pydata.org/, https://scikit-learn.org/, these are two libraries that will be heavily used, so I would say get familiar with some of the basic concepts and how they are structured. 
       - https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic - This is the introductory contest that Kaggle recommends for beginners. And this here: https://github.com/CoderHahs/ml-training/blob/master/Kaggle/Titanic/Notebooks/Titanic-EDA.ipynb, is my solution to this contest. 
       - https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-data-analysis#syllabus - This is a course I highly recommend doing as it goes over the basics needed for a strong foundation in Data Science 
       - https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-for-applied-data-science-ai#syllabus - This course is also great, but it is more advanced and again concepts are advanced. I recommend doing this course after you do the course above.
