# Challenges: Project Manager

Hey Candidates! Glad you could make it :)

We have for you a few small challenges that shouldn't be too difficult to complete!

First and foremost:

1. Create a Github account
2. Learn about Github
3. Set up Git

While it is not a Project Managers (PM) direct responsibility to work on the codebase, it is important for them to be able to still interact with it and therefore you must be comfortable with Github and Git. 

Now that you've gone over the basics, let's get our hands dirty! Here's your challenge:


## Challenge Summary

You will be given a brief description on a project, and will be presented with a task and some obstacles that a PM will typically face. 

### Project Description: BeFit 
BeFit is a fitness organization which outlines various exercise packages for different levels of participants. They also offer trainers who can come in and teach the routines in these packages in person to offices, gyms, schools etc. Further, they sell fitness merchandise and equipment. In a post-pandemic world, they realize that offering their services online will allow them to always stay in business. They want to create a website which serves as an online platform where they can provide all their services: selling merchandise and equipment, their exercise packages, a sign-up system to acquire their trainers. 

#### Task: Timeline
This project is brought to you by BeFit and now you have to plan how the project will be executed. Come up with a timeline to determine the different phases of the project, the tasks required for each phase and how long each phase will take. The different phases could include design, development, testing etc. Some examples of tasks in the development phase could be each individual page being developed such as ‘Contact Us’, ‘About Us’ etc. It can be as simple as the sample table below. Find an organized and readable way to present the timeline. 

###### Sample Table

Start Date  | End Date   | Phase
------------| -----------| --------
dd/mm/yyyy  | dd/mm/yyyy | Phase 1
dd/mm/yyyy  | dd/mm/yyyy | Phase 2


#### Obstacles: Team Conflicts

Now the project is underway, and in the duration of the project conflicts arise and it is up to you to solve them. Below, two conflicts are outline which you must find a fair and produtive solution for: 

1. Conflict 1: \n
The design of the website is due in one week. It has been split between multiple designers. One of the designers approaches you and informs you that they have a midterm exam this week and will not be able to complete their share of the work. Since SFL is a student/volunteer run organization we try to ensure that school comes first and no one is forced to overwork themselves. How do you ensure the timeline of the project is not deviated from?

2. Conflict 2: \n
All members of your team are productive and contribute equally to the project. While having group discussion however, you notice that only a few members of the team actually speak. Others don't often provide their opinion. A good leader listens to everyone’s ideas before making a decision. How do you ensure you’ve heard everyone's ideas in a supportive manner?
	
_The solutions do not need to be more than a paragraph, and can be presented in a .doc, .txt or .pdf format._

### Submission
 
Submit a folder which contains the timeline and the solutions and email it to [team@softwareforlove.com](team@softwareforlove.com).


This should be completed within _7 days_ of you being assigned this task!

Good luck!
