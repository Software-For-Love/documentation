# Challenges: Designers

Hey Candidates! Glad you could make it :)

We have for you a few small challenges that shouldn't be too difficult to complete!

## Some goals

Our goal is to:

-   Design the "Donate" page for our website!
-   Get used to working with Figma

## Background

Software For Love has worked with many non-profits and charities in the past. Through the work that we do, we have been able to donate thousands of dollars to a handful of charities. We strongly believe in the mission and the work that these organizations do, and would love to take the opportunity to promote them on a page on our website as well!

## Criteria

On this page, we would like to have a section to highlight how much we have donated to charities through our work.

We would like to showcase some charities that we have worked with in the past, and have brief descriptions about them. We would also like to have buttons to redirect to their respective websites so that our visitors and supporters can also donate directly and support these causes.

We would also like to provide visitors and supports the opportunity to donate directly to us as well. As you may know, we are also a non-profit organization and rely on financial support from external sources to support us for any expenses that we do incur. However, we must make it clear that since we are not a charity, prospective donors will not receive receipts for income tax deductions to us.

## What you need to do

You're going to design a prototype of the "Donate" page for our website using Figma!

Be as creative as you want! Remember as a good designer, you should follow styling as seen throughout our site.

This should be completed within _7 days_ of you being assigned this task!

Good luck!
