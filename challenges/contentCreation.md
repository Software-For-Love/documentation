# Challenges: Content Creation

Hey Candidates! Glad you could make it :)

We have for you a few small challenges that shouldn't be too difficult to complete!


## Part 1 

### Scenario
It is orange shirt day in September. You need to create a post that reflects SFL’s stance towards indigenous issues in Canada. Similarly, you must prepare a caption with relevant hashtags (if you see it fit). Using the fonts Inter, our company colours, the post should also reflect our work we have done with indigenous-focused groups. This information can be found on our website and throughout our social media. What do you think should be included on the post and the caption? Please remember common social media etiquette. 

#### Requirements: 
* No Copying the work of others,
* Having the right post dimensions for Instagram, LinkedIn, Facebook and prepare a Tweet.
* Plagiarism of any kind (taking the work of others without tagging or citing them) IS NOT PERMISSIBLE
* Create a posting schedule for your tweet, Facebook post, LinkedIn post, and Instagram post

## Part 2 

### Scenario
The SFL Instagram page received hate comments under the post. It says, “I chose not to wear an orange shirt today. Why wear a colour and demand children to wear a colour? There is no need to remind people in these super stressful times that kids died”. What is your course of action?

#### Tools Provided
Social media toolkit, highlights the colours we use, the fonts we use, the path we’re taking on each platform. This will be sent over to you during or immediately after the interview.

### Submission
 
Submit a folder which contains your solutions for both parts of the challenge and email it to [hr@softwareforlove.com](hr@softwareforlove.com).


This should be completed within _7 days_ of you being assigned this task! No more time should be given unless on passionate grounds.

Good luck!
