# Incident Management Protocols

* Last Modified: June 14, 2020
* Authors: Faizaan Chishtie

**!!DISCLAIMER!!**

If there is an ongoing Incident please **FIRST** go to the [Incident Checklist](https://github.com/Software-For-Love/incident-management-protocols/blob/master/docs/checklist.md) page

## Purpose

* To provide a set of protocols that will be followed by members of Software For Love when dealing with software/code related incidents (internal/external).
* To provide guidance to those affected
* To provide templates for incident reporting
* To classify different sets of risks
* To provide post-incident reporting practices

## Outline

* Incident management lifecycle
* Incident prevention/mitigation
* Incident classification
* Incident triage
* Incident protocols (abstracted lifecycles)
* Post-incident reporting (i.e. don't make the same mistake)
* Reporting/Triage templates

## Caveat

These templates/guides will serve as baseline scenarios which will **most likely not be exhaustive**.

**For our engineers:** It's important you follow the baseline scenarios and engage actively with the IcM team, we're here to help you.

**For our clients:** Our goal is to continuously improve. Our post incident reporting practices allow us to do so. 
If there are any concerns or suggestions that you'd like to make, feel free to open a ticket under the Issues tab. It is in our best interest to stay up to date.
