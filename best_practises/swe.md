# Best Practices: Software Developer

-   work log
-   ask for help early rather than later
-   github best practices
-   general coding best practices (refactoring, testing, etc)
-   kanban board (sprint planning)
-   modularization, chances are someones already solves your problem, look at code and our implemented components, try to extend that and make a component or class that works universally.
