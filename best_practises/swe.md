# Best Practices: Software Developer

-   ask for help early rather than later
-   github best practices
-   general coding best practices (refactoring, testing, etc)
-   kanban board (sprint planning)
-   modularization, chances are someones already solves your problem, look at code and our implemented components, try to extend that and make a component or class that works universally.

## Work log

As we transition to charging clients using billable hours, it is important that we keep track of the work you are doing. **It is your responsibility that the hours you work get logged**.

Your PM should send you a link to your respective team's worklog. This is an example [Google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FzZ8p6jcDI5qdJmZVgxLlgHIqx9nV8Jg39T9jLmOnEc/edit?usp=sharing) to track work hours. Kanboards are a great way to record your work as well. Simply add how many hours each task took to complete during your sprint planning sessions.
