# Best Practices: Project Manager

Leading a team of developers and designers can be nerve-wracking, but it's a rewarding experience! As the person at the helm, you have to take on the most responsibility and that can cause a great deal of stress. This guide to project management should help relieve some of it!

## Agile Methodology

Here at SFL, we believe in the [Agile Manifesto](https://assets.uits.iu.edu/pdf/Agile-Manifesto.pdf). It defines 4 values and 12 principles that are essential for project management.

Here's a diagram that highlights Agile Development:

Agile development holds iterative design at its core. The idea is to prepare a backlog of software requirements a.k.a the **Product Backlog**. It represents the tasks that have yet to be _assigned_. It is encouraged to breakdown tasks as much as possible. For example, when implementing a contact us form, you can break it down into:

1. the title,
2. inputs,
3. styling,
4. form validation (checking emails/phone numbers),
5. form submission
6. testing.

New tasks can be added at any point of a project.

Tasks that will get completed within a sprint get assigned to a **Sprint Backlog**. **Sprints** are a time period determined by the team where select tasks from the product backlog are worked on and completed. At SFL, we recommend that sprints should be a week long. During your weekly meeting with your team, dedicate time to **Sprint planning**, where you and your team decide what tasks they can complete for the week. It is important that you let your developers/designers determine what they feel they can complete during the sprint, rather than you telling them what they should do. This helps bring them confidence in what they do.

Tackling a project in sprints helps reduce the "intimidation" factor. It's like saying you're going to bike across Canada. Anyone would be intimidated by that, but if you say you're going to bike 20 km a day, that becomes a lot easier.

## Kanban Boards

Kanban boards are the best way to organize sprints. You can use tools like [Trello](www.trello.com), [Github](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/managing-project-boards/about-project-boards).

Github is recommended for software projects with implementation. You can connect issues and pull requests to tasks and organization is a breeze.

Trello is a great alternative if there is no Git repository associated with the project. This is great for design-only projects. Here is an example [board](https://trello.com/b/ZqN99gGN/agile-sprint-board) that you can follow.

## Work log

As we transition to charging clients using billable hours, it is important that we keep track of the work being done by our developers and designers. **You should be strict with this and it is your responsibility that these hours get logged**.

You can use this sample [Google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FzZ8p6jcDI5qdJmZVgxLlgHIqx9nV8Jg39T9jLmOnEc/edit?usp=sharing) to track work hours, or better yet make use of the Kanban boards to track hours. Simply add how many hours each task took to complete during your sprint planning sessions.
