## Identification



## Incident Categorization Table

| Incident Level | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| HIGH           | Incident is extremely severe: information systems of importance are at risk; and/or have been damaged. Incidents marked as HIGH should be addressed immediately.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| MEDIUM         | Incident is moderately severe: vulnerabilities and/or potential sources of risk within information systems have been detected, but are not of primary concern. Documentation and fixes should be put in place in order to mitigate future risks. The implementation of these fixes should be secondary to that of HIGH-level risk. |
| LOW            | Incident is non-existent/negligible or has been deemed out-of-scope.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
