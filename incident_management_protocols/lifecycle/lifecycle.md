## Mission

Software For Love strives to create an IT environment where assets are safeguarded, risks are containable, and critical services/procedures exist should there be an incident.

It is in our best interest to protect vital IT systems to support business activities. To do so, it is imperative that we strive to follow these IcM principles.
